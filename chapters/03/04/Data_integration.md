Data Integration
==============

Integrate data focus on combining information from multiple tables or records to create new records or value.

The integrate data process can be done by different ways such as:

- two or more tables with different information about the same object can be merged together to create a new table with fields from the source tables
- perform the aggregation operation in which new values are created from summarizing information from various records and/or tables.
