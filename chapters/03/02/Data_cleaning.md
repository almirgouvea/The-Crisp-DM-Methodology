Data Cleaning
==============

Data cleaning is an important process to ensure quality, representativeness, and unbiased.

The data cleaning process considers the following steps:
- selection of clean subsets of the data
- the insertion of suitable defaults
- estimation of missing data by modeling 

It is important to provide a clean data report containing:
- decisions and actions that were taken to resolve data quality issues
- the data transformations that took place in this step
- possible impact on the result of the project analysis
