Data Construction
==============

Construct data is the process of developing new records or producing derived attributes.

- New records focus on creating a new attribute column from a data collect.

- Derived attributes focus on constructing new of it from one or more existing attributes in the same record.

It is important to consider adding derived attributes only to facilitate the modeling process or the modeling algorithm, not to reduce the number of input attributes.
