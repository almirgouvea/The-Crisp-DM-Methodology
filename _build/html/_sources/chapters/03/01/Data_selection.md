Data Selection
==============

Several criteria must be considered when deciding which of the data will be used in the analysis:
- its relevance to achieving data mining objectives
- the quality and technical constraints such as limits on data volume or data types
- choose and explain which certain data must be included or excluded
- which attributes (columns) are more important than others
- which records (rows) are more important than others
