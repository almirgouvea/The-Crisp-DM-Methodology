Evaluation of results
=====================

Evaluation of results focuses on assessing how well the model meets business objectives:
- checking situations where the model is not efficient
- testing the models on real-world applications
- seeking for additional challenges, information or hints

At the end of this step is very important to summarize the assessment results in terms of business success criteria analyzing if the project already meets the initial business objectives.
