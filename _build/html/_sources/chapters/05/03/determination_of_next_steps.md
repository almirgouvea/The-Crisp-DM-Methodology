Determination of next steps
===========================

Determining the next steps focuses on project leader analysis to decide what should be done next:
- finish the project and start the deployment
- initiate further iterations
- set up new projects

At the end of this step is very important:
- to analyze of remaining resources and budget
- list the potential further actions with pros and cons for each
- describe the decision, the justification, and how to proceed with it
