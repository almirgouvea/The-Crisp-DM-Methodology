Generation of test design
===================================

To determine the strength, quality, and validity of the model, before building the model, is necessary running empirical testing to measure how well the model can predict history before using it to predict the future.

There are several keys steps to develop the test design:
- describe the process for training, testing, and evaluating the model
- separate dataset into train and test
- build the model in the train set
- estimate the quality in the test set
